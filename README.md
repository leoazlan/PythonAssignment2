# CP1404 Assignment 2: Travel Tracker 2.0 by Mohamed Azlan

_Edit this README, replacing this line and above with your own name/details._  
_At the end of the project, complete the project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the ... parts)._
_Note that to get high marks for this, your reflection should match the "exemplary" description from the rubric:_

> The project reflection is complete and describes development and learning well, shows careful thought, highlights insights made during code development.


## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The entire project, Assignment 2, took me approximately three weeks to complete.
I used the WakaTime plugin to track my coding hours,
which amounted to around 50 hours of active development.


## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I'm most satisfied with the way the Travel Tracker 2.0 app turned out
in terms of its user interface and functionality.
The integration of the Kivy framework allowed me to create an intuitive
and visually appealing interface for tracking travel places.
Additionally, implementing classes such as Place and PlaceCollection improved
code organization and maintainability.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
While I'm generally pleased with the project's outcome,
I'm least satisfied with the error handling in my code.
Although I implemented basic validation for user inputs,
there are scenarios where the application could crash or
produce unexpected results if users provide invalid data.
I recognize that enhancing error handling could significantly improve
the robustness of the app.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The utilization of classes, particularly the Place and PlaceCollection classes,
was a standout success in my development process.
These classes allowed me to encapsulate data and behavior
related to places effectively. They improved code organization and readability,
making it easier to manage and manipulate place data throughout the application.
The step-by-step approach of breaking down complex GUI tasks into
smaller components also contributed to a smoother development process.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
In future projects, I aim to enhance my code documentation and comments.
While the code is functional and well-structured,
adding more comprehensive comments would make it easier for others,
including myself, to understand and maintain the code. 
This improvement will be especially valuable as projects become more complex.

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
My primary learning resource for this project was
the official Kivy documentation (https://kivy.org/doc/stable/).
I referred to it extensively to gain a deep understanding of
Kivy's widgets, layout management, and event handling.
In addition to the Kivy documentation, I utilized
Python's official documentation and frequently visited Stack Overflow
to seek solutions to specific coding challenges.
These resources played a vital role in my learning and problem-solving process.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
One of the primary challenges I encountered was managing the
complexity of the Kivy GUI framework. To address this challenge,
I adopted a systematic approach of breaking down the GUI development into smaller,
manageable tasks. Each widget and feature was implemented incrementally,
tested, and refined before moving on to the next.
This approach helped me maintain focus and gradually build the
application's user interface. Additionally, I relied on online forums
and communities to seek advice and solutions when I faced specific obstacles.
Collaborating with peers and mentors allowed me to overcome hurdles
and make progress in the project.

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
My experience with classes, particularly the Place and PlaceCollection classes,
was highly positive. These classes improved code organization and
maintainability by encapsulating data and behavior related to travel places.
They allowed for the creation of multiple instances of Place,
which was essential for managing a collection of travel places effectively.
The use of classes enhanced code readability and made it easier to
work with place data throughout the application.
It also facilitated the separation of concerns within the code,
promoting a cleaner and more modular design.

This reflection captures my development journey during Assignment 2,
highlighting achievements, areas for improvement, and valuable learning experiences.
It demonstrates a thoughtful and insightful reflection on the
project's development and my learning process.
